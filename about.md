### Starting up 
I was brought up in nature, where I cycled my first bike, learned to appreciate my surroundings and respect earth’s power. Growing up in Sparta has been very fortunate, as I had to unavoidably juxtapose city life with suburban-country life, assess their pros and cons in relation to my future goals. Moving to Athens at the age of 17 came as a sudden awakening to the world of technology.

### Professional Goals
Throughout my career, I have mainly focused on the commercial aspect of the telecommunications industry and the technical aspect of the shipping industry. So far, I have always been combining my profession to the academy; to this day I hold the position of an Industrial PhD student (DTU Mechanical Engineering) in collaboration with Maersk, for which I have been working for the past 2 years in Copenhagen. My skills of research analysis on vessel hydrodynamics, data analytics and physical/mathematical modeling, as well as meticulous research on statistical learning techniques, have been critical into solving real marine industry problems.    

### Recent Occupation
The thematic of my PhD project is *“​Sensor fusion on real-time data to drive vessel performance​”*. For the project to be successful    
**(i)** sensor readings should be corrected and used along with other real-time measurements to build      
**(ii)** high-quality physics/data-driven propulsion model/corresponding fuel tables that can be scaled across the entire fleet in order to get a      
**(iii)** deeper understanding of added resistance, that constitute its main objectives.    

It is expected to contribute to a reduction of more than 1% to the fleet inefficiency compared to the 2017 index. The actual saving in USD will be highly depended on the volume transported by Maersk vessels. However, savings of 50k MT of fuel on a yearly basis should be also expected, reflecting around 20 million dollars per year.

### Apart from work..
When time isn't an obstacle, I travel on bike at as many places on earth as I can, in an effort to see the world in another point of view.

* [**Traveled almost all over Europe on bike**](http://cycloporlacara.blogspot.com) 

    In an attempt to see the most out of each country traveled, some friends of mine and I decided to some days off work and travel on bike in Europe. Since our first trip, this became an obsession. We have cycled more than 10.000km in more than 10 countries so far and our plans are to cross European borders and head East. You can find updates for past and upcoming trips on the link.

### [The Bike Trip Project]( http://www.thebiketripproject.com/ ) 

"The Bike Trip Project" is a project created for a special course named "Visualization and Analysis of Multichannel Self-tracking Data" run under the supervision of Sune Lehmann and Jakob Eg Larsen at the Technical University of Denmark. The project depicts both the personal and the general trip analytics of two cyclists crossing Europe from the north(Tallinn, Estonia) to the south(Thessaloniki,Greece) on bike. The two main topics of the course (besides data analytics and visualization) is sensory data collection with the aid of wearables and interactive visualizations in D3.js. 

### [ArXASE]( https://oikonang.github.io/ArXASE/ ) 

ArXiv Abstract Similarity Engine is a final project created by three master students fall semester 2016 in the course 02805 Social graphs and interactions, run by Sune Lehmann at the Technical University of Denmark. The two main topics of the course (besides python programming) is Natural Language Processing and Network Science. The project has hence been thought out to leverage the techniques we've learned in those topics.

### [311 SERVICE REQUESTS IN NEW YORK CITY]( https://oikonang.github.io/social_data_visualization/prj/ ) 

This project concerns an analysis created by three master students spring semester 2017 in the course 02806 Social data analysis and visualizations, run by Sune Lehmann at the Technical University of Denmark. The two main topics of the course (besides python programming) is applying some machine learning algorithms in city related databases and visualize the results in using D3.js javascrip library. The project has hence been thought out to leverage the techniques we've learned in those topics.

### [Phrasebook]( http://getphrasebook.com/ ) 

Phrasebook is a project based on an Android application created for an experiment run by three master students in digital media engineering for the course Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables (02808) taught by associate professor Jakob Eg Larsen at the Technical University of Denmark (dtu.dk) spring 2017. The topic of the course (amongst others) and the focus of the experiment is user experience and motivation.

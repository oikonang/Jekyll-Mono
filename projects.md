ArXiv Abstract Similarity Engine is a final project created by three master students fall semester 2016 in the course 02805 Social graphs and interactions, run by Sune Lehmann at the Technical University of Denmark. The two main topics of the course (besides python programming) is Natural Language Processing and Network Science. The project has hence been thought out to leverage the techniques we've learned in those topics.
